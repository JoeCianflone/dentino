are the measure used to value rewards for redemption. If a Card has multiple Cardmembers, the 
Points will be assigned to the Account of the primary Cardmember of the Card. Cardmembers earn 
"Points" in the following amounts based upon the type of purchase transaction charged to the 
Account: (a) two (2) "FunPoints" per one dollar ($1) on Carnival Cruise Lines vacation 
transactions; (b) two (2) "FunPoints" per one dollar ($1) on any purchases charged to the Sail

transfers, convenience checks, drafts, fees, interest or finance charges, purchases made on a line 
of credit, and travelers check purchases. Cash Advances at the Casino are not eligible for rewards.

Bonus "FunPoints": Cardmembers will receive five thousand (5,000) bonus "FunPoints" after the first 
use of their account for a Purchase or Balance Transfer (that are not later returned or rescinded). 
Bonus "FunPoints" will be posted to your account at the close of your billing statement after 
qualifying transaction(s) have been posted. The Balance Transfer is subject to the Balance Transfer 
Fee set forth in the Terms and Conditions. Balance Transfer Checks and Convenience Checks do not 
qualify for bonus "FunPoints". 

Balance Transfer Bonus "FunPoints": Cardmembers can earn one (1) bonus "FunPoint" per one dollar ($1) 
in balances transferred to their Carnival MasterCard requested in the first thirty (30) days after 
account opening, up to a maximum of five thousand (5,000) "FunPoints". Please note:  If you make a 
balance transfer you will be charged interest on purchases if you do not pay off your entire balance, 
which includes any transferred balance, by the payment due date each month. There is a fee for Balance
Transfers. Balance Transfer Checks and Convenience Checks do not qualify for balance transfer points.

Statement Credit: Cardmembers may redeem "FunPoints" for a statement credit toward a Carnival Cruise 
Lines, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, The Yachts of Seabourn, or
