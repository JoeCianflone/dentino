$10 gift card of your choice if one or more new Automatic Bill Payments are 
made at a service provider that accepts MasterCard for payment between 
October 15 â€“ November 15, 2012. A new payment is defined as an Automatic Bill 
Payment at a service provider using the Miles & More MasterCard card issued to 
the primary cardholder or any authorized user(s) when a similar transaction with 
the same service provider has not been posted to the account within the 60 days 
prior to October 15, 2012. To qualify new Automatic Bill Payments must: (i) be 
completed using a valid 16-digit Miles & More MasterCard card number by 
November 15, 2012, (ii) be identified to MasterCard by the service provider as 
a recurring payment, and (iii) post to the Miles & More MasterCard card account 
by December 31, 2012. Please allow 8 to 10 weeks after the end of the promotion

remain open and in good standing at the time the gift card is fulfilled. The 
gift card will be awarded to the primary account holder (as determined by the 
MasterCard account records) named on the account accessed by the MasterCard card 
used to make the qualifying purchases. Purchases from the same account but 
different cards cannot be combined.
